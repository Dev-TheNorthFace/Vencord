__With Vencord, you can install plugins as well as add themes to your Discord.__ __Go to the "Theme" category, click on "BetterDiscord Theme," and download the theme you want. The theme will be in a .css file.__ __Return to Discord, click on "Open Folder," open the "Themes" folder, and drag the .css file into the "Themes" folder.__ __Then, return to Discord, change categories, and your theme will be activated.__

__Error: My theme does not appear when I activate it.__

__Make sure you have not activated a theme offered by Discord Nitro. If you have, disable the Discord Nitro theme; otherwise, the custom theme will not be applied.__

__Error: My theme cannot be found.__

__Ensure that you have placed the .css file in the "Themes" folder. Also, check that the file is indeed in .css format, as custom themes on Discord use the CSS programming language.__

__Are there many plugins available on the Vencord version?__

__Indeed, all the available plugins may be accessible to a certain group of people.__ __Some will find the plugins interesting, while others will find them useless for their own use of Discord.__ __However, I recommend exploring all the plugins on Vencord.__

__Is Vencord a virus?__

__I have been using Vencord for almost a month. I scanned the file, as well as my entire PC, and nothing was reported.__

__Can I be banned from Discord for using Vencord?__

__Previously, with BetterDiscord, yes, because it allowed users to add homemade plugins, which circumvented Discord's security measures. With Vencord, no additional code or plugin available on Vencord violates Discord's rules.__
